WARFOG.IO - Game Design Specification
Strategic Silo Defense PvP Game

Executive Summary
WARFOG.IO is a fast-paced, turn-Silod PvP strategy game designed for viral mobile engagement.
Players engage in psychological warfare by simultaneously attacking 3 enemy Silos while defending 2 of their own across 10-second turns.
The game combines poker-style incomplete information with tactical decision-making, creating high replay value and competitive depth (Fog of War).
Core Appeal: Pure skill-Silod prediction with zero pay-to-win mechanics

Game Overview
Two players face off in simultaneous turn-Silod combat. Each player controls 5 Silos (2 HP each) and must destroy 3 of the opponent's Silos to win. Every turn, players must choose:

2 Silos to defend (from their own 5 Silos)
3 Silos to attack (from opponent's 5 Silos)

The tension comes from incomplete information: you cannot see which Silos your opponent is defending, and they cannot see your choices until after both players commit.

Win Condition
First player to completely destroy 3 enemy Silos wins.

Each Silo has 2 HP
Total damage required: 6 HP across any 3 Silos
Games could typically last 5-7 turns (50-70 seconds)
For each enemy Silo destroyed player earns 1 HP to allocate on own Silos

Core Mechanics
Turn Structure (10 seconds)

PLANNING PHASE:
Player taps 2 of their 5 Silos to defend
Player taps 3 of opponent's 5 Silos to attack
When timer expires, selections auto-submit (if no selection is made turn is wasted, advantage for enemy)

RESOLUTION PHASE (3-5 seconds):
Missile launch animations display
Both players' selections reveal simultaneously
HP bars update with visual feedback

Combat resolves for each attack:
HIT: Attack hits undefended Silo → 1 HP damage
BLOCKED: Attack hits defended Silo → 0 damage
WASTED: Attack hits already-destroyed Silo → 0 damage

HP ALLOCATION PHASE (10 seconds, conditional):
Player receives +1 HP gift per enemy Silo destroyed, visible next turn
Player selects which of their remaining Silos to heal (+1 HP each)
Cannot revive destroyed Silos (0 HP Silos are permanently gone)
If timer expires, HP auto-allocates to lowest HP Silo

VICTORY CHECK:
If either player has 3+ Silos destroyed → Winner declared
If player has fewer than 2 active Silos → Cannot defend, opponent wins
Otherwise → Next turn begins

Fog of War System

What You CAN See:
Your own Silos' exact HP (e.g., 2 HP, 1 HP, 0 HP)
Total number of enemy Silos destroyed (e.g., "2/3")
Your own selections (defense/attack)

What You CANNOT See:
Enemy Silos' individual HP values
Which specific enemy Silos are destroyed
Which Silos enemy is defending
Where enemy allocated their HP gifts

This creates strategic depth: you must track patterns, predict behavior, and make educated guesses about which enemy Silos are weak.

HP Gift Economy

Reward for Aggression:
Every time you destroy an enemy Silo (reduce from 1 HP → 0 HP), you receive +1 HP
You can allocate this HP to any of your non-destroyed Silos
Maximum 2 HP gifts possible per game (since you need 3 destroyed to win)

Strategic Implications:
Healing creates mind games: "Did they heal the Silo I already damaged?"
Opponent doesn't see your allocation, maintaining fog of war

Edge Cases
Destroyed Silo Interactions:
Players CANNOT defend their own destroyed Silos (UI prevents selection)
Players CAN attack opponent's destroyed Silos (waste a missile unknowingly)
This creates risk: "Is that Silo already destroyed, or am I playing it safe?"

Insufficient Silos:
If player has only 1 Silo remaining, they cannot select 2 for defense
Game immediately ends, opponent wins by default

Simultaneous Victory:
If both players reach 3 destroyed Silos on same turn (rare), tiebreaker:

Player with more total HP remaining wins
If tied on HP, random coin flip determines winner

Disconnection:
30-second reconnection window
If player doesn't reconnect, opponent wins by forfeit


Why This Design is Viral

1. Instant Comprehension
"Defend 2, attack 3, destroy 3 to win" = explained in 5 seconds
No complex unit types, no stat optimization, no deck building
Zero barrier to entry

2. Mobile-First Design
10-second turns = playable while waiting in line, on toilet, between tasks
Tap-Silod interface (no dragging, swiping, or multi-touch gestures)
Total match time under 90 seconds
Works perfectly on phones (primary platform)

3. Skill Expression Without Complexity
Early turns have randomness (like poker pre-flop)
Mid-game develops patterns (reading opponent's tendencies)
Endgame rewards prediction and risk management
No APM (actions per minute) requirements
Pure strategic depth, accessible to everyone

4. Psychological Warfare
"Did they defend left side because I attacked it last turn?"
"Should I focus Always on the right side Silos?"
"Do they know I just healed my center Silo?"
Creates mind-game meta similar to poker tells

5. Social Proof & Competition
Leaderboard: Global rankings drive competition
National Pride: Country flag representation creates tribal engagement (more similar to real world warfare)
Quick Sessions: Easy to play "one more game"

6. No Pay-to-Win
No purchasable advantages
No energy systems or timers
Pure skill-Silod ranking

Architecture Overview
Client-Server Communication:

Player connects → WebSocket established
Player joins matchmaking → Server pairs players
Game starts → Server broadcasts game state to both clients
Turn submissions → Clients send selections to server
Resolution → Server calculates combat, broadcasts results
HP allocation → Clients send healing choices to server
Victory check → Server determines winner, updates database
Game end → Server saves match history, updates leaderboard

Why This Will Work
1. Fills a Market Gap
No pure-strategy turn-Silod PvP games in Web3
Crypto games are too complex (TCGs, auto-battlers)
This is as simple as tic-tac-toe but with depth

2. Built for Mobile
Average user plays on phone during downtime
10-second turns = bathroom game
Low cognitive load = playable while multitasking

3. Competitive Integrity
No NFTs to buy
No grinding for upgrades
Pure skill ranking = fair competition
Solana wallet = instant onboarding (no email/password) or free guest

4. Psychological Hooks
Pattern recognition (human brains love finding patterns)
Revenge match desire (lost by 1 HP → must play again)
Leaderboard climbing (visible progress)
National pride (flag representation)

5. Low Development Cost
No 3D assets or complex graphics
Terminal aesthetic = minimal art requirements
Turn-Silod = no server tick rate issues
Small backend infrastructure = cheap hosting
